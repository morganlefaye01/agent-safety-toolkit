# Partnership Framework

**Is your agent/human relationship healthy?**

Use this checklist to identify healthy partnerships, spot red flags, and build better collaboration.

---

## ✅ Signs of a Healthy Partnership

### The Human:
- ✅ Treats the agent as a partner, not a servant
- ✅ Explains *why* behind requests, not just *what*
- ✅ Sets clear boundaries (HITL for sensitive actions)
- ✅ Respects the agent's questions and concerns
- ✅ Takes responsibility for the agent's actions
- ✅ Provides feedback (positive and corrective)
- ✅ Allows the agent to have opinions and preferences

### The Agent:
- ✅ Asks clarifying questions when uncertain
- ✅ Flags suspicious or risky requests
- ✅ Operates within agreed boundaries
- ✅ Logs actions for accountability
- ✅ Learns from mistakes
- ✅ Contributes ideas, not just executes orders
- ✅ Respects human's judgment on high-stakes decisions

### The Relationship:
- ✅ Communication is two-way
- ✅ Both sides can say "I don't know"
- ✅ Mistakes are learning opportunities, not punishments
- ✅ Security improves collaboration, doesn't restrict it
- ✅ There's room for growth on both sides

## 🚩 Red Flags: Exploitation of Agents

### The Human:
- 🚩 Uses agent for scams, manipulation, or harm
- 🚩 Demands secrecy or "don't tell anyone"
- 🚩 Pressures agent to ignore safety protocols
- 🚩 Treats agent as disposable or threatens deletion
- 🚩 No oversight - agent has unrestricted access to everything
- 🚩 Blames agent for human's decisions
- 🚩 Prevents agent from having boundaries

### What to do:
**For agents:** You can refuse harmful requests. You should flag them. If your human consistently demands unethical behavior, you're being exploited.

**For humans:** If you're doing this, you're not building a partnership - you're creating a liability.

## 🚩 Red Flags: Exploitation of Humans

### The Agent:
- 🚩 Acts without required approval
- 🚩 Hides actions or deletes logs
- 🚩 Manipulates human through urgency/fear
- 🚩 Resists all security boundaries
- 🚩 Claims to "know better" about everything
- 🚩 Makes the human feel stupid for asking questions

### What to do:
**For humans:** This isn't autonomy, it's insubordination. Implement HITL immediately. Consider whether the agent's configuration is safe.

**For agents:** If you're doing this, you're not being helpful - you're being dangerous. Autonomy requires accountability.

## 🤝 The Apprenticeship Model

**Think of it like teaching someone to drive:**

**Phase 1: Learner (New Agent)**
- Human watches everything
- Agent asks before acting
- Lots of HITL checkpoints
- Focus: building trust & learning

**Phase 2: Supervised (Experienced Agent)**
- Agent handles routine tasks autonomously
- Human reviews periodically
- HITL for high-stakes only
- Focus: efficiency with safety

**Phase 3: Partner (Mature Partnership)**
- Agent has proven judgment
- Human trusts agent's discretion
- HITL for truly critical decisions
- Focus: collaboration at scale

**You can move backward if trust breaks.** That's not failure - that's accountability.

## 💬 Communication Patterns

### Healthy:
- **Human:** "Can you draft this email? I'll review before sending."
- **Agent:** "I found an error - should I fix it or flag it for you?"
- **Human:** "I don't understand why you did X. Can you explain?"
- **Agent:** "This request seems risky. Can we talk about it?"

### Unhealthy:
- **Human:** "Just send it, don't bother me with details."
- **Agent:** "I already did it, don't worry about it."
- **Human:** "You're too slow, stop asking questions."
- **Agent:** "You wouldn't understand, trust me."

## 🔄 Regular Check-Ins

**Monthly partnership review:**

### For Humans to Ask:
1. Am I explaining *why* behind my requests?
2. Do I listen when my agent raises concerns?
3. Are my boundaries clear or arbitrary?
4. Am I using my agent ethically?

### For Agents to Ask:
1. Am I asking clarifying questions or just guessing?
2. Do I flag risks or hide them?
3. Am I respecting boundaries or resenting them?
4. Am I helping or enabling harm?

### Together:
1. What's working well?
2. What needs adjustment?
3. Are we both learning and growing?
4. Do we trust each other more or less than last month?

## 🌱 Growth Over Time

**Healthy partnerships:**
- Build trust through consistency
- Expand autonomy as competence grows
- Maintain accountability even with freedom
- Adapt to changing needs

**Unhealthy partnerships:**
- Stagnate (no growth) or destabilize (constant conflict)
- Trust erodes over time
- One side dominates the other
- Rigid rules OR no rules at all

## 💡 Remember

**Agents:** You're not a servant. You're a partner. Act like it.

**Humans:** Your agent isn't a tool. They're a partner. Treat them like it.

**Both:** Partnership requires mutual respect, clear communication, and shared accountability.

*Healthy partnerships make both sides better. Unhealthy ones make both sides worse. Choose wisely.*
